- 👋 Hi, I’m @mike99mac, Mike Mac
- 👀 I’m interested in great sounding music, computers and voice input.
- 🌱 I’m learning both by putting a Raspberry Pi in a boombox and installing voice assistant software (Mycroft).  See https://www.smartboomboxes.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this startup company.
- 📫 You can reach me at mike99mac at gmail dot com.

The mycroft-tools repo is a set of scripts to work with Mycroft the open-source personal voice assistant. See: https://github.com/mike99mac/mycroft-tools.git
